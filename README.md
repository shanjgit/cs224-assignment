# Stanford CS224D/CS224N: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning

Notes
-----
* The assignment 1 is based on [CS224d Spring2016](http://cs224d.stanford.edu/). I wrote this assignment in `Python3.7` environment and bumped into encoding issues when running q4_sentiment.py and q4_softmaxreg.py. I struggled for a while and finally gave, deciding to move on to cs224n, the newest version of this course, for the rest assignment.

* Handout written by latex for the assinment 1 will be uploaded later.
