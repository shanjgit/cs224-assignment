# Stanford CS224D/CS224N: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning

Notes
-----
* The assignment 1 is based on [CS224d Spring2016](http://cs224d.stanford.edu/). I wrote this assignment in `Python3.7` environment and bumped into encoding issues when running **q4_sentiment.py** and **q4_softmaxreg.py**. I struggled for a while and finally gave up, deciding to move on to [CS224N Winter2019](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/), the newest version of this course, for the rest assignments.

* Handout edited in latex for the assinment 1 will be uploaded later.
